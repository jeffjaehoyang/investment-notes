# Investment Notes
"The individual investor should act consistently as an investor and not as a speculator." - Ben Graham

I'm interested in the stock market, and am also an active investor myself. More often than not, I find myself wondering "Should I buy x shares of this stock?" If you have been in a similar situation, you might be in the right place.

### What, Why, How

I built this tool to get in the habit of recording investment decisions I make, while having the joy of being able to visualize my decisions. If I did make an investment, how much has it gone up/down by, and what was my reasoning behind the investment? If I decided not to make an investment, how has the stock performed since then, how much trouble did I save myself from, or did I lose out on a rocket-ship of a stock that's headed to the moon? What were the reasons why I did not decide to invest?

These are all some of the questions that can be answered with Investment Notes.
